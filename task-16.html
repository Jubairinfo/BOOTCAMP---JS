        // const c = 30; // ERROR: const does NOT allow redeclaration.

        // 4. Logging and explaining behavior
        console.log("var a:", a); // Result: 10 (Works and allows redeclaring)
        console.log("let b:", b); // Result: 8 (Works for reassigning, but not redeclaring)

        

        /* OBSERVED BEHAVIOR:
           - 'var' is function-scoped and very flexible (reassign/redeclaring works).
           - 'let' is block-scoped; it allows reassigning values but prevents redeclaring the variable.
           - 'const' is block-scoped and strictly constant; once set, the value cannot change.
